### Overview
<p align="justify"> Those who follow financial news are accustomed to reading analysts’ opinions explaining the daily rises and falls of stock markets. In Brazil, market movements associated with political events often generate heated debates on the internet. Some users attribute market declines or increases to their preferred politician, while others downplay the event, arguing that the movement was similar to what was observed in other countries. </p> <p align="justify"> Setting political passions aside, this article seeks, using causal inference tools, to identify whether a given fluctuation in the Brazilian stock market was intrinsic or merely another routine movement of the global market. To this end, we apply the synthetic control methodology to two distinct episodes: the notorious Joesley Day [1] and the crash observed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [2]. The analysis of these events allows us to contrast Brazil-specific impacts with global market movements, as Joesley Day represents a local event potentially confined to the Brazilian market, whereas the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a global shock that simultaneously affected stock markets across multiple economies. </p>

### About the Data
<p align="justify"> To construct the synthetic control for the Brazilian stock market, represented by the EWZ ETF, 43 ETFs tracking equity indices from other countries were used. The data are daily and consist of adjusted closing prices obtained from Yahoo Finance. The series were transformed into percentage returns to eliminate scale differences across markets and reduce non-stationarity issues. Initial missing observations were removed to ensure proper temporal alignment of the series. </p>

### Methodology
<p align="justify"> We construct a synthetic portfolio composed of ETFs from different countries whose pre-treatment dynamics resemble those of the Brazilian stock market. This portfolio is used to estimate the counterfactual behavior of the Brazilian equity market—that is, how it would have evolved in the absence of the shocks associated with the Joesley Day episode and the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

### Results and Conclusions
<p align="justify"> The results indicate that Joesley Day generated a statistically significant effect specific to the Brazilian market, evidenced by the pronounced divergence between EWZ and its synthetic control and corroborated by the placebo tests. In contrast, in the COVID-19 scenario, although the decline in the Brazilian market was substantial, its behavior was not statistically distinct from that observed in other markets, suggesting a synchronized global movement. </p>
